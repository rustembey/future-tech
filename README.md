# Project Name

## Project Description
This project is a 6-page website developed using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: for the structure and content of the pages.
- **SCSS**: for styling and organizing the CSS code.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: for interactivity and dynamic features.

## Architecture
The website is built using a **component-based architecture**.

- The **BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)** methodology was used to structure the CSS and HTML.
- Each BEM block is implemented as a separate component, ensuring modularity and code reusability.

## Functionality
The following features were implemented using JavaScript:

- **Modal Window**: for displaying pop-up windows with additional information or forms.
- **Custom Select Input**: for styling and enhancing the standard select element.
- **Tab Navigation**: for switching between content sections on the page.

## Installation and Setup
### Clone the repository:
